# shiny-excel-template

A simple shiny app to build customized spreadsheets based on user inputs

## Overview

This project uses the shiny package for R to display a web-based form for user inputs.
The app then creates a spreadsheet based on the user inputs.

The app demonstrates how to select between different spreadsheets to use as templates.
This can be useful vastly different outcomes are desired.

Minor formatting edits and inputting user data into the spreadsheet at runtime are also demonstrated.
